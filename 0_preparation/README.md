## Instructions:
You will get the most out of the CIML Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before to the event, youâ€™ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

To help you get the most out of this workshop, this section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Expanse, to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks

##  HPC Systems Accounts: <a name="accounts"></a>
* For the CIML Institute, we have created TWO types of **Training** accounts for you: 
  * **(1) XSEDE and Expanse portal ID**
  * **(2) Local Expanse user account**
* Note: The two topics below will be covered on the Preparation day (1.2 Accounts, Login, Environment, Running Jobs and Logging into Expanse User Portal).

### Logging onto the Expanse Portal: <a name="logon-portal"></a>
* XSEDE training accounts to access the Expanse portal have already been created for you. Please do not create a new one on your own. See email sent from cwong@sdsc.edu for your XSEDE & Expanse acount with the subject link "CIML 2022 Summer Institute: Account Set-Up". 
* Once you have received your XSEDE and Expanse portal ID information, go to https://portal.expanse.sdsc.edu, to confirm your login.
* For a short (18 min) video on using the Expanse portal, see [here](https://education.sdsc.edu/training/interactive/sdsc_si21/1.3_Expanse_User_Portal/).

### Logging onto Expanse using your "Local Expanse user account": <a name="logon-expanse"></a>
* You will be given an account on the SDSC Expanse computer. Information on the account will be sent to you via email. Please complete the process of activating your account before the institute begins.
